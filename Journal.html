    <h2>
    	
    	 Before I go into my project, I want to talk about the background that inspired me to make it about immigration. Currently in the USA, only around 23% of Americans are bilingual. Meanwhile, in countires in europe, they have the same rate when it comes to being trilingual. I think it is very embarrassing for us a "leading" nation to have such satistic. Even more when we are such a diverse nation but we fun of those who can not speak english 100% correctly. Immigrants, escpially Hispanic immigrants have been the root target for ridicule, rascims and overall just mistreament from our goverment.This immigrants make up most of our bilingual population but they are the most disrecpted
    </h2>

    <h2> Born bred americans can never understand the fear and confusion of being in a strange country, were you dont know the language, no job and no support system. My hope's for this game is to let these americans live in the shoes of immmigrants with this interactive experiance. Hopefullym with this we'll treat strangers with more kindness.

    <h2> For this project, I will start off by having the main charater (you) in a typical Spanish class. The teacher during this lesson will actually be giving a class lesson. If the user decides to listen or not, is up to them. At some point, the user will start to fall alseep and the last image that they will see is of their angry teache. Cut to the the next scene, the user will wake up in a foregin  latin country. In this foregin country (probs ecaudor cause gotta represent) nothing will be in enlgish. The user must nagivate everyday obstacles with whatever knowledge of spanish they have on hand. These obstacles will include interactions with the public, getting around and buying nesseacties. The goal of the interactive game is to get to the embassy in a 6 day period. I will not be completely heartless, I will add a sort of hint menu ( just in case the user gets completely stuck). However, I will also add that if the user fails interacting with their enviroment more than 5 times. they will be exiled and force to start the game all over again.
